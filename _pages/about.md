I am a Research Scientist at [Lilt](https://lilt.com){:target="\_blank"}. I have worked on cross-lingual, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning for neural machine translation. Currently, I'm focusing on the personalized adaptation of translation models and an efficient computer-assisted workflow for human translators.

I have a long-lasting dream of building an agent that understands and speaks languages of any country or planet in any style or tone. I want the agent to be [compassionate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyUxYflkhzo){:target="\_blank"} and thoughtful with a good understanding of the situation, like [Gerty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_(2009_film)){:target="\_blank"}.
